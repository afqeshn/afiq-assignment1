    <h4>INTEREST IN IT</h4>

    <p>What is your interest in IT (Information Technology)? When did your interest in IT start?  
    Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any). 

 
    IT itself to me is considered as a whole language on its own. That sparked curiosity within me to learn and understand it even more as the spectrum of its capability to produce something into reality has no limit. As time moves forward, technological involvement will keep on increasing no matter which industry it is. The idea of pursuing IT was initiated back in high school where I was taught the basics of programming. In addition, it improved my view of how technologies are created behind the scenes before being produced all over the world. 

 

    Why did you choose to come to RMIT (Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology)? 

 

    University is a big step forward in life. Moreover, I had to take a year-gap to sit back and be cautious about where my next part of journey should be as I do not want to waste years of my life somewhere I would not be fully satisfied and regret the decision. Hence, I held talks with my teachers back in high school to hear out their opinions of studying in Melbourne. They gave positive feedback about this significant location as it is well known for its universally recognized student living conditions throughout the world. There were many other university options that I could easily attend to. However, hearing from my elder brother’s experience throughout his IT journey here in RMIT has been nothing but outstanding. Therefore, it persuaded me into studying at RMIT with excitement even though there would be bumpy roads ahead that I would need to overcome. 

 

    What do you expect to learn during your studies? 

 

    To improve in every aspect. Does not matter if it is from the extremely basic or towards the complicated topics. Being able to fully understand and execute information according to the scenario’s liking would be a sign that I have made progress throughout the course. Therefore, I will thrive to take a step forward if that day comes to reality. </p>

    A description (in your own words) of the position, and particularly what makes this position appealing to you. 

    The role in the following designated company would be to aid game developers throughout their production. Also, always being aware and constantly finding errors within the program, so that it runs smoothly. Moreover, the salary that has been offered on the contract is undeniably high and worth making a living on my own. Even though the word ‘game’ is not the point of having fun around during the work time, I feel like it is something I am familiar with since I was young, so I would not have a tough time understanding the mechanics of it during production. 

    A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position. 
    
    The company is looking for individuals who have years of experience with programming, especially with C++ language and can overcome any problems that come their way with ease without depending on others. However, the position is only open to Australian Permanent Residents or Citizens. 

    A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience you currently have. 

    I have a basic understanding of how programming works as I started learning it back in high school. Then, before studying at RMIT, I decided to refresh my memory of the fundamentals in programming languages by referring to any websites that I managed to come across. 

    A plan describing how you will obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position, building on those you have now. 

    Firstly, I will give it a go at an online course that Mr. Anthony Clapp has recommended for us to try on. Secondly, I would focus on C++ language as it is a requirement in the contract that has been offered by the company. Lastly, I would try my best to seek aid from others whenever I have time to do so on any problems I encounter. </p>

    <h4>PERSONAL PROFILE</h4>

    <p>The results of an online Myers-Briggs test. 

    Adventure; ISFP-T 

 
    The results of an online learning style test. 

    Auditory: 25% 

    Visual: 40% 

    Tactile: 35% 

    The results of one further online test of your choosing.  

    The Big Five Personality Test 

    Openness – 71% 

    Conscientiousness – 54% 

    Extraversion – 29% 

    Agreeableness – 94% 

    Neuroticism – 60% 

 

    What do the results of these tests mean for you? 

    It states the characteristics I have as an individual and I noticed the things in common which keep on appearing between these 3 tests. It helps me be more aware of my attitude amongst other people as well.  

    How do you think these results may influence your behavior in a team? 

    I do not think it would influence anything in a group project. Every group project is full of individuals who are born differently from one another. If every single individual cooperates and works efficiently towards the purpose of the project, then it should be fine. Regardless of each other’s insecurities, without other members judging or even looking down on them. It is all about teamwork and playing their part. 

    How should you take this into account when forming a team? 

    I would not rely 100% on the statistics that have been made through an online website about their personality because it may not be fully accurate of how they are as a person. However, I would keep an eye on the negative traits if they were to be mentioned.  </p>

    <h2>PROJECT IDEA</h2>

    <p>The words above remind me of something like what I felt when I was kid. A big project that I would create that could be brought into reality. However, the situation back then was significantly different in comparison to now. Therefore, individuals now, especially amongst teenagers, are much more sensitive to their emotions in their daily life whether they need to talk to someone or approach someone they have feelings for. With the up-to-date technologies we as humans have developed globally, I would like to introduce an application where strangers decide a restaurant, they both would like to meet at. It would be a perfect application amongst teenagers as the romance life and feasting together combo cannot be implemented better enough. 

    Social media nowadays plays a big part in all these negative thoughts within human beings whether we like it or not. It is something bound to happen to every living human being at one point in their life. Social anxiety disorder is the third most common mental health disorder after depression and substance abuse. As a teenager myself, viewing others on my feed having the time of my life while I am just staying at home initiates jealousy naturally. So, with this application, which is planned to be made into reality, sparks that hope of reaching out to others or even leading to an unexpected friendship or romance that could go on forever. It is a platform that attracts the market to teenagers as it is a period in their life meeting and getting to know other people. 

    The main purpose of building this significant application is to allow two strangers to meet each other at a restaurant located due to their liking. However, users can view the application whichever way they want it to be. It can be a platform where it is used for reaching out to others, making new friends, or even looking for a romantic relationship. It has a wide spectrum of possibilities, so it may be aimed at teenagers, but other age categories could hop on the platform too. Firstly, the first page will be requesting your background information for future use which can be viewed by other users including a picture of yourself. However, it must be taken at the present time and pasting photos from smartphone’s album will be restricted. This is due to avoid any possibility of scamming or being defrauded by other users. Secondly, the next page will be a list full of other users that you can scroll up and down to, in random descriptions on them. Therefore, for it to have according to your preferences, we decided to have a feature at the top which enables the user to pick whatever they prefer in a person. It will have options for gender, age, type of food preference etc. This will cut down the available number of users around your current location from the previous setting. Next, after the user has found the person, they are interested in, they would have to swipe right indicating they would like to meet up with that specific person. If all goes well, they will receive a notification stating it is a match which indicates they agree on meeting the user too. Next, both users would be brought to a new page which allows them to have a chat and introduce themselves. This section would be the time for each user to decide on where the venue is they would like to meet. It can be breakfast, lunch or even dinner. It all depends on the users, and we do not set a specific timing for them or every other user on the platform. Once the users have finished their meet up, everyone will have the chance to give good or even bad feedback about their experience. Then, a question will pop up on the screen questioning whether they would like to have a second meet up with the other user. If both agree on that, the application will bring them back to the chat section and continue their experience however long they want it to be. This application would be the talk amongst people globally as it helps connect each other while feasting on their favorite meal. How awesome is that? That is why I call it Fluid Room as it mixes a suitable number of combos at once. 

    The software that will be used is Zoho Creator. It is known to be efficient and world renowned for mobile apps development. It is up-to-date development software without the ancient traditional hassle such as maintenance. Then, Fluid room would have its own website as it can be noticed by users who are not as active with their smartphones as they are on computers.  

    To develop an application, the team working behind the scenes must consist of high standard individuals. Programmers must have a vivid understanding of the language they are insisted to write on, the brand image and layout of the applications must be created with creativity and theme by individuals in charge of the task and most importantly, a team leader who is capable of guiding team members and treating each other with respect for them to work smoothly towards the purpose. 

    Finally, the aim for the success of this project is to finally let individuals with life problems have another platform in mind to reach out to others, especially in current society. This will help them stay away from depression and spark hope inside of them to live a better life. Also, for people who are bored of other dating sites, this could be an option as well, even though it is not the main purpose of this application but there is still a possibility of going that path if they would like to. Conclusion, it is to connect and build network with each other around the user’s area, so that no one is left out in society.</p>
